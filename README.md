CKAN frontend in node.js.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/frontend-v2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/frontend-v2)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/datopian/frontend-v2/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/datopian/frontend-v2?branch=master)

## Quick Start

Tested on NodeJS v8.10.0.

Clone the repo, install dependencies using yarn (or npm) and run the server:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

To run and watch HTML:

```bash
# note the -e which means we watch for changes in templates too
nodemon -e "js html" index.js
```

To run and watch everything:

```bash
npx gulp
```

This runs the server and watches for changes to CSS and icons. On changes to CSS [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and plugins ([postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import), [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/)) are run. On icon changes, the SVG icon sprite is remade. These processes can be run without watching via `npx gulp css` and `npx gulp icons`.

Icons are used like so: `<svg><use xlink:href="#<filename>" /></svg>`. Eg. to use the search.svg icon, you use `<svg><use xlink:href="#search" /></svg>`.

Note: Unless you are making significant changes to the design, you probably won't need these processes. Most styling is done through [Tailwind's](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes.

## Set up your own backend

*By default, the app runs against mocked API so you don't need to setup your own backend.*

To change environment variables, you can rename `env.template` as `.env` and set the values.

### DMS

Setup `API_URL` environment variable so it points to your CKAN instance, e.g., for demo.ckan.org it would be:

```
export API_URL=https://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/
```

### CMS

Use `WP_URL` environment variable to point to your WordPress instance. For example, we have test wordpress blog here https://edscms.home.blog/ so it would be:

```
export WP_URL=https://edscms.home.blog/
```

## API

*All of the controller and views use the API module - they donâ€™t see backend.*

We have separated API module into `DmsModel` and `CmsModel`. The former part talks to CKAN (or can be any DMS), while the latter fetches content for static pages, for example, it can be WordPress. Below is the flow of how it works together:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Browser->>Controller: /
    Controller->>Browser: home.html

    alt Exists in CMS
      Browser->>Controller: /about
      Controller-->>CMS: slug=about
      CMS-->>Controller: found: page content
      Controller->>Browser: static.html

      Browser->>Controller: /news
      Controller-->>CMS: slug=news
      CMS-->>Controller: found: list of posts
      Controller->>Browser: blog.html

      Browser->>Controller: /news/my-blog-post
      Controller-->>CMS: slug=my-blog-post
      CMS-->>Controller: found: post content
      Controller->>Browser: static.html
    end
    alt Not Found in CMS
      Browser->>Controller: /search
      Controller-->>CMS: slug=search
      CMS-->>Controller: not found: 404
      Controller-->>DMS: search api
      DMS-->>Controller: result: list of data packages + summary
      Controller->>Browser: search.html

      Browser->>Controller: /org/gdp
      Controller-->>CMS: slug=org/gdp
      CMS-->>Controller: not found: 404
      Controller-->>DMS: getPackage api
      DMS-->>Controller: result: data package
      Controller->>Browser: showcase.html
    end
```

If above doesn't render, here is the screenshot:

## Routes

Here is the summary of existing routes at the moment:

* Home: `/`
* Search: `/search`
  * with query: `/search?q=gdp`
* Showcase: `/organization/dataset`
* CMS:
  * About: `/about`
  * Blog: `/news`
  * Post: `/news/my-post`
  * Anything else: `/foo/bar`

## Tests

Run tests (note that tests are running against mocked API_URL set to http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/):

```bash
yarn test

# watch mode:
yarn test:watch
```
